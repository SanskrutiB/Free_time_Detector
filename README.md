# User_Busy
This user busy app was designed as our Assignment Project.It shows the time intervals of the day when the user is busy.
Features:
1.	You can check user is busy or free for hourly time intervals of the day.
2.	It gives you the scope to select threshold value and select test span from calendar.
3.	It also gives the total number of missed calls during the given span.
Testing Environment:
I have used Android Studio to make the application and it has been successfully tested on all the API levels on or above 21.
App uses Material theme, so make sure you first fix the import issues for the Material API in case you have any.(Android Studio performs it automatically)
